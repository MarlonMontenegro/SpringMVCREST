# Building REST Services with Spring and Spring HATEOAS

This project demonstrates the creation of RESTful services using the Spring framework, along with the implementation of HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) principles. It enables you to perform various operations on employee resources, including creating, updating, deleting, and finding employees.

## Project Overview

In this project, we've developed a Spring MVC REST controller that produces hypermedia-powered content. This means that the API follows the HATEOAS principle, allowing clients to navigate the API seamlessly.

### Features

- **Create New Employees**: You can create new employee resources by sending POST requests to the appropriate endpoint.

- **Update Existing Employees**: Existing employees can be updated by sending PUT or PATCH requests with the necessary data.

- **Delete Employees**: Employee resources can be deleted using DELETE requests.

- **Find Employees**: The API provides multiple ways to find employees:
  - Find a specific employee by their ID.
  - List all employees.
  - Search for employees based on simple or complex properties.

## Technology Stack

This project uses the following technologies and frameworks:

- **Spring Boot**: For building and running the application.
- **Spring HATEOAS**: To simplify the creation of REST representations that follow the HATEOAS principle.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For interacting with a database.
- **RESTful API**: To expose endpoints for CRUD operations.
